README.txt - DWS1000 example firmware using the DW1000 API
=============================================================================

DWS1000 Example firmware for the ST Nucleo-F429ZI devboard.

Note:

Most Nucleo-F429ZI devboards used at Decawave have the 0R resistor on SB121
moved to SB122, changing the MOSI pin of SPI1 from PA7 to PB5. Make sure to
define USE_PB5_MOSI_PIN in Inc/main.h to use these examples on boards with
this modification.

The DWS1000 example firmware package  is composed of the following folders:

    - Src/decadriver:
    
      Driver for DW1000 UWB transceiver IC.. Details about each function can
      be found in DW1000 API Guide.

    - Src/examples:
    
      A set of individual (simple) examples showing how to achieve different
      functionalities, e.g. sending a frame, receiving a frame, putting the
      DW1000 to sleep, two-way ranging.  The emphasis of these examples is
      to be readable with explanatory notes to explain and show how the main
      features of the DW1000 work and can be used.

    - Src/platform:

      Platform dependant implementation of low-level features (IT management,
      mutex, sleep, etc) for the Nucleo-F429ZI devboard.
      
    - Drivers, Inc, Middlewares:
    
      Hardware abstraction layer (system start-up code and peripheral
      drivers) for ARM Cortex-M and ST STM32 F4 processors. Provided by ST
      Microelectronics and generated by CubeMX tool. The Cube MX project
      file DWS1000_CubeMX.ioc is included in the root folder.
 
Please refer to DW1000 API Guide accompanying this package for more details
about provided API and examples.

v1.0.1 (28 April 2020)
=============================================================================

Use default SPI1 configuration of Nucleo-F429ZI.

=============================================================================
v1.0  (08 April 2020)
=============================================================================

Initial release of DWS1000 examples. Based on DW1000 Application Programming
Interface package v2.14 / Driver v5.1.0  (20th December 2018).

- Target was changed from EVB1000 to ST Nucleo-F429ZI devboard with DWS1000
  Arduino shield.
- Output was changed from LCD on EVB1000 to debug UART on Nucleo devkit
- The Low Power Listen examples where removed due to undocumented wake-up
  behaviour.
