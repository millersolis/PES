 *  @brief   TX Bandwidth and Power Compensation over Temperature example code
 *
 *       This example application adjusts the bandwidth and power settings of the DW1000 to account for transmit bandwidth
 *       and power variations across temperature. It then enables continuous frame mode to transmit frames without
 *       interruption for 2 minutes before stopping all operation. The adjustment takes into account the temperature
 *       difference from a known reference temperature, at which the bandwidth and power of the transmit spectrum should
 *       be optimised and the PG_DELAY and TX_POWER register values read and stored. Adjusting for temperature variations
 *       relies on these reference values as well as the difference in temperature.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. Continuous frame mode is typically used to tune transmit power for regulatory purposes. This example has been designed to reproduce the use case
 *    of a tag blinking at a high rate: the blink frame length is around 180 �s in this configuration, emitted once per millisecond. In this configuration,
 *    the frame's transmission power can be increased while still complying with regulations. For more details about the management of TX power, the
 *    user is referred to DW1000 User Manual.
 * 2. The reference measurements are made after optimising the transmit spectrum bandwidth and power level to maximise the use of the allowed spectrum
 *    mask (the mask used was the IEEE 802.15.4a mask). This optimisation needs to be carried out once for each individual unit, perhaps in a production test environment, and
 *    the reference measurements to be stored are the temperature at which the optimisation is made, the contents of the TX_POWER [1E] register and
 *    the contents of the PG_DELAY [2A:0B] register and the contents of the PG_COUNT [2A:08] register. For more information, see App Note APS024
 * 3. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 4. The temperature can be read in a number of ways, such as using an external temperature sensor, or the temperature sensor on the host processor.
 *    Here, the temperature is read from the DW1000 using this API call. The temperature is in the MSB, and raw value is used here.
